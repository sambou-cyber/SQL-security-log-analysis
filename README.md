# SQL-security-log-analysis
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to investigate potential security incidents by analyzing employee data and login activity. Using structured queries with `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, date, and time filters, I examined authentication logs and employee records to identify suspicious behavior and support security operations.
